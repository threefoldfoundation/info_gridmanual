# ThreeFold Farm Management & Setup

To create a Farm and manage it, you need a 3Bot. If you don't have one yet, head to the [Get a 3Bot section](3bot) of this manual before continuing.

In this section, we will help you get started with your farm:

* [Configure a Farm](farm_init)
* [Prepare a 3Node](3node_prepare)
* [Boot a 3Node over USB](boot_3node_usb)
* [Manage Farm & Nodes](3bot_farm_mgmt)
* [Manage your Farm wallet](configure_wallet)

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach us on the [Farming Section on the Forum](https://forum.Threefold.io/c/Threefold-grid-support/farmer-discussion).
