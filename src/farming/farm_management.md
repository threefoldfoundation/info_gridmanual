# ThreeFold Farm Management & Setup

To create a Farm and manage it, you need a 3Bot. If you don't have one yet, head to the [Get a 3Bot section](3bot.md) of this manual before continuing.

In this section, we will help you get started with your farm:

* [Configuring a Farm](farm_init).
* [Prepare a 3Node](3node_prepare).
* [Booting a 3Node Over USB](boot_3node_usb).
* [Managing your Farm & Nodes](3bot_farm_mgmt.md).
* [Managing your Farm wallet](configure_wallet.md).

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach us on the [Farming Section on the Forum](https://forum.Threefold.io/c/Threefold-grid-support/farmer-discussion).
