# TF Grid Simulator

![](./img/simulator_intro.png)

The ThreeFold Grid and Token Simulator allows you to simulate the future behavior of the grid.

It allows you to simulate hardware and see how the hardware could potentially behave inside the TF Grid.

You could access the simulator [here](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/simulator_configure).
