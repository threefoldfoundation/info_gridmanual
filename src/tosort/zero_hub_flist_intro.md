[0-hub](https://hub.grid.tf) is the repository of publicly available flists, the Virtual File System for Containers.

The flist contains some major improvements compared to the container processing in the market, fetching the file system when starting the container in the Zero-OS node is similar to Docker images handling.
Moreover, it is really simple to convert your existing Docker image into a flist. The Docker Hub Converter does this for you and publishes it on the [hub](https://hub.grid.tf). Once converted the container is usable on the Threefold Grid, out of the box !
