# Introducing: ThreeFold NOW (Demo)

[__The ThreeFold NOW Demo__](https://demo.testnet.grid.tf/) is a marketplace for (in demo mode) open source peer-to-peer solutions that are built on top of ThreeFold Grid.

Its main goal is to enable a simplified solution-deployment on top of the TF Grid without the necessity of technical system administration knowledge. 

<!-- > See [__Getting Started Manual__](threefold_now_getting_started.md). -->

On its alpha version on Testnet, there are already open-source solutions deployed on top of the TF Grid, covering various fields from a peer-to-peer video platform, online publisher and many more to come.
