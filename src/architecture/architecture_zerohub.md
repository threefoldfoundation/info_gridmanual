# Zero-OS Hub

## Build and use containers

Zero-OS hub is the repository of publicly available flists, the Virtual File System for Containers and Virtual Machines. 

The flist contains some major improvements compared to the container formats in the market, but we made it in a way that it is fully compatible with Docker, the best known container format available.
Even more, it is really simple to convert your existing Docker file into a flist. The docker Hub Converter converts any existing Docker image into a flists, publishes it on the hub. Once converted the container is usable on the Threefold Grid, out of the box !
