# Quantum-safe Storage system

![](img/archi_qsfs.png)

- Even quantum computers cannot hack and "decrypt" data
- data can never be lost, unlimited history, auditing on digital ledger layer
- 10x less power utilization (green)
- data distributed in controlled way over X nr of chosen locations, but none of the locations has enough data to reconstruct the original = super reliable/safe
