# container

This primitives allow a user to run its application into a container on a node.

## Reservation definition

Here is the schema used to define a 0-DB namespace reservation:

- **NodeId**: the node ID on which to create the volume
- **Flist**: the URL of the [flist](#flist). This URL needs to be reachable by the node. This is usually a URL to https://hub.grid.tf/
- **Environment**: The environment variables to set inside the container. This is usually used to configure the application running in the container
- **SecretEnvironment**: It is the same as `Environment` but these value are encrypted
- **Entrypoint**: It is the program to start when the container is created
- **Interactive**: If set to true, coreX is started in the container and the value of `Entrypoint` is ignored. See [the coreX section](corex---the-0-os-container-process-manager) for more detail
- **Volumes**: This is where you define which [volume](./volume.md) to mount inside the container.
  - **VolumeID**: the ID of the volume
  - **Mountpoint**: the path into the container filesystem where to mount the volume
- **NetworkConnection**: This is where you define the network of the container
  - **NetworkId**: The name of the network created using a [network](./network.md) primitive.
  - **Ipaddress**: net.IP: The IP address to give to the container
  - **PublicIp6**: If this is true, the container will have an extra network interface with a Public IPv6 address. This is useful when you want to expose service directly to the public internet and out of your private overlay network

## Example using sdk

```python
zos = j.sal.zosv2

# create a reservation
r = zos.reservation_create()

# add container reservation into the reservation
zos.container.create(reservation=r,
                    node_id='2fi9ZZiBGW4G9pnrN656bMfW6x55RSoHDeMrd9pgSA8T', # one of the node_id that is part of the network
                    network_name='<network_name>', # this assume this network is already provisioned on the node
                    ip_address='172.24.1.10', # part of ip_range you reserved for your network xxx.xxx.1.10
                    flist='https://hub.grid.tf/zaibon/zaibon-ubuntu-ssh-0.0.2.flist', # flist of the container you want to install
                  # interactive=True,  # True only if corex_connect required, default false
                    env={"KEY":"VAL"},
                    entrypoint='/sbin/my_init') #

# define the expiration date
expiration = j.data.time.epoch + (10*60) # 10 minutes

# register the reservation
registered_reservation = zos.reservation_register(r, expiration)

# pay for the capacity reserved
wallet = j.clients.stellar.default
zos.billing.payout_farmers(wallet, registered_reservation)

# inspect the result of the reservation provisioning
time.sleep(5)
result = zos.reservation_result(registered_reservation.reservation_id)
 
print("provisioning result")
print(result)
{'Namespace': '60-3', 'IP': '2a02:1802:5e:1102:e85a:41ff:fedb:2c65', 'Port': 9900}
