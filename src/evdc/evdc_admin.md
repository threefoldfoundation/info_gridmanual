After successfuly deploying an eVDC from the eVDC Deployer, you can access your eVDC Admin panel via the given link on your [Deployed eVDCs List](evdc_manage.md).

With eVDC Admin Panel, you can now deploy and manage your workloads on each active eVDC via the __eVDC admin panel__. This admin panel will support you to execute many eVDC functionalities, such as accessing your eVDC wallet, deploying decentralised solutions on the marketplace, upgrading your eVDC compute nodes, and many more.

The admin panel for your eVDC is made of 2 parts: 
- __My VDC__ gives you the access to overview your compute nodes, storage nodes and the wallet that is set up specifically for funding the resource provisioning of your VDC. 

- TF NOW Marketplace allows you to deploy workloads onto your VDC.
