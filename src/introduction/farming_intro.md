## Farming: Putting Capacity Online On The ThreeFold_Grid

### What is a Farmer?

The ThreeFold_Grid is formed by ThreeFold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect compute and storage hardware (also known as servers) called 3Nodes to the ThreeFold_Grid. The compute and storage capacity of 3Nodes mint [ThreeFold Tokens](threefold:token_what) for the Farmer as a reward. Once the farmerâ€™s capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid gets reserved by a user he gets ThreeFold_Tokens. This is called capacity cultivation income.

### Types of ThreeFold Farmers

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers

- Certified Farmer: Buys certified hardware and signs a contract with ThreeFold Tech for support.
- Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.
