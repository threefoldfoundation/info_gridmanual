## Farming: Putting Capacity Online On The ThreeFold Grid

### What is a Farmer?

The ThreeFold Grid is formed by ThreeFold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect compute and storage hardware (also known as servers) called 3Nodes to the ThreeFold Grid. The compute and storage capacity of 3Nodes mint [ThreeFold Tokens](token_what.md) for the Farmer as a reward. Once the farmerâ€™s capacity on the ThreeFold Grid gets reserved by a user he gets ThreeFold Tokens. This is called capacity cultivation income.

### Types of ThreeFold Farmers

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers

- Certified Farmer: Buys certified hardware and signs a contract with ThreeFold Tech for support.
