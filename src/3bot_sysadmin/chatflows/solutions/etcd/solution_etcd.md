# ETCD
A distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system

## Steps to Deploy ETCD

### Add the solution name. Keep in mind it will also be the subdomain.

### Ask for Automatically Select Node
Here we could provide a node id corresponding to a current node on the grid to deploy the container on. If there is no specific node to be used then it is choose `Yes`.
