# Get a Hosted 3Bot

3Bot is your virtual system administrator which helps you to deploy solutions on top of the ThreeFold Grid.

## How to Deploy your 3Bot

- For __Mainnet__ Go to [3Bot Deployer Website](https://deploy3bot.grid.tf) : launched on Monday 21 Sept 2020
- For __Testnet__ Go to [3Bot Deployer Website For Testnet](https://deploy3bot.testnet.grid.tf) 

> IMPORTANT: The two networks are completely separated, and thus every activity done on testnet cannot be applied to the mainnet, and vice versa. For example, you cannot purchase capacity on TF Grid Mainnet by using the Testnet TFT you have on your testnet wallet. <BR>
> To learn more about the distinction between testnet & mainnet [see this doc](mainnet_testnet)

### Name Your 3Bot

This name will be used to identify this 3Bot. Keep in mind that this name will also be used as your 3Bot's subdomain (a part of your 3Bot's web address

### Select the Back Up & Restore Password

Your 3Bot has a backup and restore feature accessible on the dashboard.

### Choose the 3Bot's Expiration Time

The expiration time determines your preference for how long you want to keep this 3Bot live. This will also calculate the amount of internet capacity you need to purchase in order to keep the 3Bot online. No worries, you can always extend your 3Bot's life span by extending your capacity reservation.

### Pay for Your Capacity by using a Stellar Wallet

You will be shown payment details as below. Send the required amount to the mentioned address on your screen by using a stellar wallet. Please do not forget to mention the reservation ID on the memo text section when you're sending your payment. The memo text is used to identify a payment, therefore sending a payment without a memo-text could result in a failed transaction.

##### Remark: 

- If you are working on the mainnet of the TF Grid, production TFT is to be used for payment on the Stellar Mainnet (as is visible in your 3Bot Connect wallet). 
- The testnet of the TF Grid is connected to the Stellar Testnet, so Testnet TFTs are to be used (you cannot use your 3Bot Connect wallet).
