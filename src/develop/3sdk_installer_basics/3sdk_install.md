## Installing js-sdk

After preparing the dependencies on your system

### Installation using pip

Just doing `python3 -m pip install js-sdk` is enough 

### Installation for experts or developers

This version of the SDK tries to be isolated as possible for developers or end-users, and we are achieving that level of isolation using poetry for the whole development/publishing process.

- To install poetry `pip3 install poetry` or from [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Threefoldtech/js-sdk`
- Prepare the environment and the python dependencies

 ```bash
 cd js-sdk
 poetry update
 poetry install
 poetry shell
 ```

After installing the js-sdk you can invoke it in your shell by executing `jsng`. This should spawn a shell inside your terminal.
