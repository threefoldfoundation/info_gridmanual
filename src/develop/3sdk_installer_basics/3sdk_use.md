## Get your 3Bot words

You will be asked the mnemonic words from your 3Bot Connect App during installation. Here is how to find them in the app:

- From 3Bot Connect Application go to settings, then show phrase to get your mnemonics
- Take a note of the 3Bot name and your email
- When registering for the first time you could use these private words in your configurations
- These words are needed, they are your private key.


### Using the 3Bot Connect App words (mnemonics)

- You have to use same username & same email

## Runnning 3Bot

After the [installation](3sdk_install.md) steps you should have an executable `3Bot`

- in case of pip it should be available for the user
- in case of poetry you need to be in the isolated environment using `poetry shell`

3Bot server could run using `threebot start --local` starts a server on `8443, 8080`. If you want to use `80, 443` ports you need to set capabilities for nginx binary (in case of linux) or install as root in case of OSX

### Setting capabilities for nginx

To be able to run as a normal user, you don't need it if you are root.

```
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `which nginx`
```

### Starting 3Bot

- After setting capabilities for nginx, we could just do

 ```bash
 threebot start
 ```

- This will take you to configure your identity, It will ask you about the network you want to use, 3Bot name, email, and words.

- Then it will start 3Bot server where you will see some thing like that
