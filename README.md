## How to contribute

Controbution is welcome.  The TF Grid and the technology is an open source project and we welcome external help to make this project even better.  This manual is all about how to get started with the Software Development Kit,from downloading it and installing the SDK to executing workloads.

The steps needed to get the documentation on your device are:
- install the mdbook software
- get the content from the repository
- if you want to edit, create your own branch to edit

### How to install mdbook
On macOS this can best be done by using brew.  Brew is a package manager and can be found [here](https://brew.sh/).
```bash
brew install mdbook
```
For other operating systems the install process can be found [here](https://snapcraft.io/mdbook)

### Get the documents (content)
The documentation is online but can also be downloaded for reading purposes and or updating/editing. 

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/github/threefoldfoundation
cd ~/code/github/threefoldfoundation
clone https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tfgridsdk/ -b development
```

#### Use mdbook locally
```bash
cd ~/code/github/threefoldfoundation/info_tfgridsdk
#will open local browser
./serve.sh
```

#### Helping us to improve and edit the wikis

Branches and there purpose

**Master** This branch containes the information which is currently considered as production content.

**Development** This branch is used to be the staging branch before things are pulled into master.  Normally we try to have at the end of the day all the branches that are used for personal development and work to be pulled into the development branch.  Development is pushed into master every few days.

**Other branches**  Everyone that wants to participate in this projects, please create your own branch from development (clone the developement branch from the repository and create your own branch).  Please consider dooing a pull request at the end of every day in order for the branches not to divert too much.
